# Morphing-Cube-Animation

We make the cube with glassmorphism and a circular ring.

A toggle button which defines the shape of the element.

If the the color of toggle button is red then the shape of element is red, and if the color is green then the shape of element is circular ring.

First, of all we make the shape of cube with 12 faces. Here will be two cubes one of size is less than the outer cube.

We will make the ring with 12 faces by transform it by 30 degree each from the corresponding faces.
